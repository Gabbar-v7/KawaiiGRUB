## Changing Fonts

1. Locate the `theme.txt` file inside the theme directory.

## Customization

To customize the theme, open the `theme.txt` file in the theme directory. Here, you can modify:

- **Font**: Change the font setting.
- **Background**: Set your preferred background image. Replace `background.png`
- **Colors**: Adjust colors for selected/unselected menu items and more.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues during boot, ensure that the paths in `GRUB_THEME` and other settings are correct.
- Use `grub-mkfont` to convert TTF/OTF fonts to `.pf2` format if you wish to add custom fonts:
  ```bash
  grub-mkfont -s 25 -o custom_font_25.pf2 font.ttf
  ```
- Issues with applying fonts may arise due to secure boot, try turning it off in the BIOS.

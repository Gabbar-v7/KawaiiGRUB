## Changing Fonts

1. Locate the `theme.txt` file inside the theme directory.
2. Change the `item_font` parameter to use your preferred font file, e.g., `item_font = "roboto_bold_25.pf2"`.

## Customization

To customize the theme, open the `theme.txt` file in the theme directory. Here, you can modify:

- **Font**: Change the font setting.
- **Background**: Set your preferred background image. Replace `background.png`
- **Colors**: Adjust colors for selected/unselected menu items and more.

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

- **Incorrect Paths**: If you encounter issues during boot, ensure that the paths in `GRUB_THEME` and other settings are correct. Double-check the location of the theme directory and the `theme.txt` file.
- **Custom Fonts**: If you want to use custom fonts, ensure they are in the correct `.pf2` format. Use `grub-mkfont` to convert TTF/OTF fonts:
  ```bash
  grub-mkfont -s 25 -o custom_font_25.pf2 font.ttf
  ```
- **Secure Boot**: Issues with applying fonts or themes may arise due to Secure Boot. Try disabling Secure Boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings.

### Debian-based Systems

- **GRUB Update Fails**: If `sudo update-grub` fails, ensure that the `GRUB_THEME` path is correct and that the theme files are properly copied to `/boot/grub/themes/`.
- **Missing GRUB Directory**: If the `/boot/grub/themes/` directory does not exist, create it manually:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /boot/grub/themes/
  ```

### Arch-based Systems

- **GRUB Configuration Not Applied**: If the theme does not appear after updating GRUB, ensure that the `GRUB_THEME` line is correctly added to `/etc/default/grub` and that the `grub-mkconfig` command is executed successfully.
- **Missing GRUB Directory**: If the `/boot/grub/themes/` directory does not exist, create it manually:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /boot/grub/themes/
  ```
- **GRUB Installation**: Ensure GRUB is properly installed on your system. If not, install it using:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S grub
  ```
